              <p style="text-align: left;">In the element of Water we literally deal with matters of life and death, of our genetic inheritance and all of our ancestors. Strangely, this is also the element of emotions. We all have to understand that our emotions have already been lived through by someone in our family tree, and they are passed on from generation to generation, mostly through the role of the mother.</p>
              The ruling planet of Aquarius, Uranus has a timid, abrupt and sometimes aggressive nature, but it also gives Aquarius visionary quality. They are capable of perceiving the future and they know exactly what they want to be doing five or ten years from now.<br></p>
        <p>
        Uranus also gave them the power of quick and easy transformation, so they are known as thinkers, progressives and humanists. They feel good in a group or a community, so they constantly strive to be surrounded by other people.
        
        The biggest problem for Aquarius-born is the feeling that they are limited or constrained. Because of the desire for freedom and equality for all, they will always strive to ensure freedom of speech and movement. Aquarius-born have a reputation for being cold and insensitive persons, but this is just their defence mechanism against premature intimacy. They need to learn to trust others and express their emotions in a healthy way.
